# ECOS — Manifesto

## On the captured echo and the perceptive archive

### The confined measurement

Consumer sonar devices — fishfinders, depth sounders — produce a real acoustic measurement. Sound travels through water, bounces off the bottom, off vegetation, off suspended matter. The device captures this echo and turns it into an image.

But this measurement is confined. The raw data — the acoustic samples, the return signal envelopes — are locked inside proprietary systems. You cannot export them. You cannot redistribute them. The screen becomes the only sanctioned output: a rendering, an interpretation, an image that the manufacturer decided to show you.

### The screen as primary source

When the raw data is unreachable, the screen image becomes the primary source. Not a perfect source — it carries the biases of rendering algorithms, color maps, gain settings, screen resolution. But it is a faithful trace of what the instrument "decided to show." It is a perceptive record.

ECOS takes this position seriously: the screen recording is not a degraded copy of something better. It is the most accessible, most shareable, most reproducible form of the sonar observation. It is the echo we can actually work with.

### The perceptive archive

By combining a screen capture (MP4) with a simultaneous GPS trace (GPX), ECOS builds a spatial volume — a three-dimensional reconstruction of what the sonar showed, placed in geographic context. This is not a bathymetric survey. It does not claim metric truth. It claims perceptive coherence.

The result is a volume you can slice, rotate, explore. A readable archive of an underwater observation session. Something you can share, compare, revisit. An "echo of echoes" — captured, structured, opened.

### What ECOS is not

- Not a bathymetric tool — it does not produce metrically calibrated depth maps.
- Not a scientific instrument — the source data is a screen image, not raw acoustic samples.
- Not a replacement for professional survey software.
- Not dependent on any sonar brand or protocol.

### What ECOS is

- A tool for building readable, shareable, explorable volumes from consumer sonar screens.
- An assertion that the screen capture is a valid primary source.
- An accessible bridge between consumer devices and scientific visualization.
- An open archive format for underwater perceptive data.
- A starting point — not an endpoint.
